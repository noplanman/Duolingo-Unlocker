##Details

This script visually unlocks all skills in a language tree, making it possible to practice and complete any skill you want.
NOTE: As a side-effect of completing a newly available (now unlocked) skill, the tree up to that skill is permanently unlocked by Duolingo! So even if this script is disabled, all skills before the completed one will become available.

You will also find a progress bar at the top of the tree, showing how many points are necessary to reach the next level.
